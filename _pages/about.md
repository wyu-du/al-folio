I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in [Computer Science at University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science). I am advised by Professor [Yangfeng Ji](http://yangfengji.net/) in the [Information and Language Processing (ILP) Lab](https://uvanlp.org/).

My research primarily focuses on developing controllable human-AI collaborative text generation systems, which comprise three components:
<ul>
  <li><b>Modeling User Intentions</b>: designing user intention taxonomy to interpret user goals in various contexts (<a href='https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.250/'>ACL2022</a>, <a href='https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.715/'>EMNLP2022</a>). </li>
  <li><b>Controlling Text Generation</b>: controlling the generation of LLMs through fine-tuning parameter-efficient modules (<a href='https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.188/'>EMNLP2021</a>), modeling variational context variables (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01227'>SPNLP2022</a>), and reinforcement learning (<a href='https://aclanthology.org/D19-1619/'>EMNLP2019</a>, <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00953'>2023</a>).</li>
  <li><b>Reducing Annotation Cost</b>: utilizing LLMs for data annotation and selection in domain-specific tasks (<a href='https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.201/'>EMNLP2022</a>).</li>
</ul> 


In the past, I was fortunate to work with many amazing NLP researchers.
I have worked with [Song Feng](https://songfeng.github.io/), [James Gung](https://jgung.github.io/about/), [Yi Zhang](https://www.amazon.science/author/yi-zhang) and [Saab Mansour](https://www.amazon.science/author/saab-mansour) at AWS AI, [Vipul Raheja](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vipulraheja) and [Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) at Grammarly, and [Liwei Wang](https://lwwangcse.github.io/) at Tencent AI Lab.

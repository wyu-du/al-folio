I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Computer Science at University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science). I am advised by Professor [Yangfeng Ji](http://yangfengji.net/) in the [UVA ILP Lab](https://uvanlp.org/)

My research interest is machine learning and natural language generation. In particular, I am interested in conversation modeling, few-shot learning, interactive and iterative text generation, open-domain dialogue generation & evaluation, and reinforcement learning for dialogue systems.

In the summer of 2021, I was advised by [Vipul Raheja](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vipulraheja) and [Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) as a NLP research intern at [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/about), where I worked on iterative text refinement tasks, including human editing pattern analysis and text refinement system design.
In the summer of 2020, I was advised by [Liwei Wang](https://lwwangcse.github.io/) as a NLP research intern at [Tencent AI Lab](https://www.tencent.com/en-us/about.html), where I worked on communicative intent flow for open-domain dialogue evaluation.

I am an applied scientist at [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), working with [Dr. Yanjun Qi](https://qiyanjun.github.io/Homepage/) on trustworthy LLMs.
I obtained my Ph.D. in [Computer Science at University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) in 2024, advised by [Professor Yangfeng Ji](http://yangfengji.net/).

My research primarily focuses on developing controllable human-AI collaborative text generation systems, which comprise three components:
<ul>
  <li><b>User Intention Modeling</b>: modeling user requirements with user intention taxonomy to build and evaluate controllable LLMs (<a href='https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.250/'>ACL2022</a>, <a href='https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.715/'>EMNLP2022</a>). </li>
  <li><b>Controllable LLMs Development</b>: controlling the generation of LLMs through fine-tuning parameter-efficient modules (<a href='https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.188/'>EMNLP2021</a>), modeling variational context variables (<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01227'>ACL-WS2022</a>), self-training (<a href='https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.201/'>EMNLP2022</a>) and reinforcement learning (<a href='https://aclanthology.org/D19-1619/'>EMNLP2019</a>, <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00953'>2023</a>).</li>
  <li><b>Human-AI Interaction Application</b>: developing human-AI collaborative writing systems (<a href='https://aclanthology.org/2022.in2writing-1.14/'>ACL-WS2022</a>).</li>
</ul>
